## Top 10 Things You Need to Know About Me

◆ I live in Ottawa with lovely wife and two wild boys (13 & 10). Garden in the backyard, golf, hockey, gym.

◆ Developed a solid set of values that have guided me well over the years. Gone thorugh a few periods of growth thanks to some fantastic coaches and a bunch mistakes. Always happy to talk and jam on this subject.  I've given a [few talks](https://github.com/tackaberry/algonquin-professional-practice) on the subject over the years.  Ask me about the Rambling Fabulist and the Virtuous Kingtide.

◆ Identify internally with buddhism but really just as a means and alignment helping to lead an uncomplicated, happy life. Its helped me manage stress and maintain a calm approach to work and life. 

◆ Voracious reader, always tackling the CBC and Giller prize lists. Still killing trees to read books - no ebooks, no audiobooks.   [Find me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6959336-brett-tackaberry). See the Reading List below - these are the books that have shaped my career. 

◆ I'm a systems thinker (big and small), I lead with continual improvement, contribution and collaboration. Empathy, inclusion.  

◆ I build teams with values based in [Modern Agile](https://modernagile.org/) and [DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops).  I help companies run on agile - not just developers. Further to this, I build Development and Data literacy within companies. I try to make coding and data accessible to all regardless of staff role within the company.

◆ I'm a strategic thinker. I help teams - leadership, departmental, adhoc - work from a mission to develop objectives and initiatives.
