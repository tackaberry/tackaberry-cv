                            <p>I've been working with technology for the last 20+ years, building engineering teams to solve problems through <span>engineering excellence</span>. I've worn many hats from software engineer to Chief Technology Officer, always translating complex product visions into technical roadmaps and deployed products - and everything in between. I believe in <span>positive</span> impact and building trusted relationships and rapport with everyone. </p>
                            <p>Iâ€™ve always contributed to a wider concept of social impact through my work on Tech4Good, CivicTech and RHoK, and after a year of coaching and personal reflection, <span>I am realigning and committing to collaborate and work on the climate crisis.</span> </p>
                            <p>Are you also working on climate change? Are you interested in discussing engineering leadership and management? Let's have a chat!</p>
